This Android application, developed with Unity, allows users to play and control various sound layers such as music, 
ambient sounds, and sound effects (SFX). Designed to enhance the immersive experience for both Pen & Paper players and the storyteller, 
it dynamically links the different music layers with multiple Philips Hue lights. 
These lights adjust the room's ambiance in sync with the soundscapes. For instance, thunder, gunshots, or a calm forest ambiance can rapidly 
or slowly change the lighting atmosphere, further immersing players in the story.
